It has been years that I have this 'Git-Phobia' because I did not know what github is and how it works. I usually feel it to be some hard thing. Thanks to HNGi7 internship, now I have a git repository and gradually understanding it. Although, at first I was scared too when the task was given out but I had no choice but to face my fear if I really want to excel in this program, which I  am certain I want to get to the top in it. #ConqueredGitPhobia.
